		<stem_vignette>The worst fire in the history
of Lincoln National Forest, New
Mexico, raged for weeks in 1950.
When the flames were out, when
the thunder and crackle of blazing
trees had died down, a badly burned
bear cub was found clinging to a
tree. A weary firefighter snapped his
picture, then rescued the hurting
and bewildered cub.
The rangers named him Smokey
after the familiar poster character
Smokey Bear, a cartoon bear in a
rangers hat and blue jeans holding
a shovel. He had been created in
1944 by the U.S. Forest Service to
publicize a campaign to prevent
forest fires. Posters of the cartoon
bear read Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires! and were tacked up in every
national forest and park as well as in public buildings.
Then the real Smokey came along. The rangers nursed him
back to health and sent him to the National Zoo in Washington,
D.C. Photographs of the badly burned cub, his playful recovery,
and his life in Washington sent the popularity of the cartoon
Smokey Bear skyrocketing.
With all the publicity, the living Smokey Bear became one
of the most popular animals at the National Zoo. Thousands of
visitors dropped by to see the black bear who limped on one leg
and still bore scars from the fire that some careless camper or
smoker had started. Smokey s misfortune became the best reason
for preventing forest fires. He even made public appearances.
Eventually he had his own Smokey Bear fan club. Membership was
in the many thousands. Children who signed up to be
Junior Forest Rangers received not only a Ranger kit but an
official-looking badge and pictures of the real and the
cartoon Smokeys.
In May 1975, when he was twenty-five years old (which is
equal to seventy in human years), the National Zoo and the
Forest Service retired Smokey in an impressive ceremony. At the
same time, they introduced Smokey Junior, an orphan of another
fire in Lincoln National Forest. Smokey Senior died a year later.
His remains were buried at the Smokey Bear Historical Park
in Lincoln National Forest, and today his message lives on:
Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires!
